# Fundations for productivity, motivation and discipline

## Porpoise

### Find the Fuel

2. What would your life be like if you were capable of making a pretty good salary off of your games?
3. What's your definition of success?
4. What sorts of sacrifices are you willing to make to archive those goals?

## Proactivity

If you want to CHANGE your results, you need to CHANGE something you're doing. Yui need to BREAK SOME PATTERN.

Write the stuff i can do to make this possible.

Not being the only one who cares.

Convince yourself

## Different techniques and when to use them

### Try to create a method tha will:

- Allow you to do a lot with little time
- Empower you to archive goals
- Give you discipline
- Keep you accountable
- Help you filter what is important
- Give you structure, but also flexibility

### Possible methods:

- No method at all! Great for hobbyists because it maximizes having fun in the process
- List of tasks that you feel your game needs
- Classic PMO Project Management - "Waterfall"
- Agile - SCRUM, Kanban
- Daily Productivity
    Create list of task for every day and base on how many completed task have been done, mark te day as success or failure.
    Try to not brake a streak or proportion.
- Laser-focused goals + Daily productivity
  For time to time think from afar and create goals for mid/long term.

### Daily Productivity + "CEO"

- Json Rohrer - Don't break the chain
- Every 2 weeks, lok from afar and be a CEO.
  - Figure out what is REALLY IMPORTANT to help you really achieve your goals
  - What are the high leverage approaches that are available for those goals
    - Normal thing - X effort = X result
    - Hight leverage - X effort = 10X result

Example:
> 11/30/2020 - Failure
> -[X] Task 1
> -[ ] Task 2
> -[ ] Task 3
>
> 11/30/2020 - Success
> -[X] Task 1
> -[X] Task 2
> -[ ] Task 3

### The first 5%

Use the the first 5% of any task to figure out:

- Hight leverage ways to do that
- Ways to do that in 1/10 of the time
- Ways to multiplay the result of that by 10

### Backlog of ideas

Keep note of all of your important ideas

### Pomodoro

Commit to just 25 minutes of REALLY FOCUSED work + 5 minutes of rest.

- When a piece of work is particularly challenging
- You can't get yourself to do it
- When you can't really estimate how long a task will take

Start low on how many pomodoros a day.
Don't use the pomodoro time for every task, it's very tiring
**If you can't even do 1 pomodoro a day, quit dreaming.**

### 4 AM Alarm Clock

- During commercial hours, you will need to do stuff that is KINDA outside of your control
- At 4 AM, only you are awake!
- Often your best (most productive) hours
- Show to yourself that you are really committed
- Very difficult to procrastinate
